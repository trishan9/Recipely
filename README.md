# Recipely - A Recipe Sharing App

## Overview
Recipely is an Android-based mobile application designed to simplify and enhance the process of sharing, saving, and accessing recipes. The idea for this project stemmed from a real-world problem faced by my elder sister, who works in the hotel industry. She, along with her colleagues, often relies on manual, paper-based methods to store and share recipesâ€”a practice that is both inefficient and prone to errors. Recognizing the need for a dedicated digital platform, I developed Recipely to address these challenges while also catering to a broader audience, including homemakers, students, and cooking enthusiasts.

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Mobile Application Development SP5000C0M** module's coursework: **Android application development with Kotlin**. It demonstrates the practical application of Kotlin programming, Firebase integration, and user-centric design principles taught during the course.

## Problem Statement
In professional settings like the hotel industry, chefs and trainees often face significant challenges in managing recipes. Traditional methods, such as handwritten notes in notebooks, are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to organize. This inefficiency extends beyond professionals to homemakers, students, and hobbyists who wish to learn and share recipes. Recipely addresses these issues by providing a centralized, digital platform where users can easily create, save, and share recipes.
